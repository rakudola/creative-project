        <h2 id="ch1-begin">Chapter 1</h2>

        <p>Being in a high-profile professional string quintet has its advantages. Slogging 
          through Pachelbel's Canon for the third performance in a month is not one of them.</p>
          
        <p>The museum you're performing in is one of those fancy art museums designed by some 
          bigwig highbrow architect(s) ft. some bigwig highbrow interior designer(s), and it shows in 
          the lines of construction, the artful columns, the natural lighting, the avant-garde 
          use of color and form. (That's a lot of art words you aren't entirely sure on the meaning 
          of, but your friend, fellow violinist, and resident art forger {{name}} has said them a 
          few times each, and it's important to be adaptable in your line of work.)</p>
          
        <p>All the art words in the world, unfortunately, cannot hide the fact that your cellist 
          is literally asleep. If anyone bothered to look in your ensemble's general direction, 
          that would be more of an issue. As it stands, she's staying on beat a lot better than 
          last time.</p>
          
        <p>{{name}} leans over to you and says, seamlessly matching the voice level of the room, 
          "Should we wake her up?"</p>
          
        <p>"You're concert master," you reply with enough of a shrug to fudge the next slur. 
          Exactly zero people notice.</p>
          
        <p>{{name}} grins at you. "Can I break into an improv solo?"</p>
        
        <p>See, you aren't so far gone that you think letting {{name}} break into what would most 
          certainly devolve into a very, very bad medley of every song Namewee's released in the 
          last five years is a <i>good</i> idea. Heavens, no. It sure is an idea that would keep 
          you from joining your lovely cellist in the realm of the unconscious, though.</p>
          
        <p>"You're concert master," you say instead of voicing your true feelings on the matter.</p>
        
        <p>{{name}} shoots you a face you aren't sure how to interpret.</p>
        
        <p>Before you get a chance to ask {{objPro}} what in the world that's supposed to mean, 
          the bassist (and unofficial leader, because {{name}} should not be trusted with any 
          <i>thought</i> of responsibility) stops playing, puts her instrument down entirely, and 
          walks over to the both of you. You notice a single woman whisper something to the man 
          she's with and point at your bassist in mild confusion. Nobody else seems to care.</p>
          
        <p>"Auction's starting soon," your bassist says. "Play to the end as soon as you can."</p>
        
        <p>"Finally," {{name}} sighs.</p>
        
        <p>"A tempo," your bassist finishes.</p>
        
        <p>{{name}} full-on pouts. "Just because I try to be efficient--"</p>
        
        <p>"Double speed isn't efficiency. It's just hard to follow."</p>
        
        <p>You tune out their semi-joking argument, because they legiterally had the same one on the two-
          hour ride here. And bring it up at least once a week.</p>
          
        <p>They go for about twelve measures before {{name}} finally says "what's the plan?"</p>
        
        <p>The bassist glances at your sleeping cellist and unenthused violist. "We're gonna 
          slip out while you two are packing up. {{name}}, I'll call you when we need you. Is 
          your phone on vibrate?"</p>
          
        <p>{{name}} pulls out {{posAdj}} phone. "Yeah."</p>
        
        <p>"Perfect. We don't need anything big this time around." She leans a little closer to 
          the both of you and drops to a whisper. "Security's pretty lax."</p>
          
        <p>A sparkle flickers to life in {{name}}'s eyes. You definitely are not getting paid 
          enough for this gig to cover the emotional trauma of whatever's about to happen.</p>
          
        <p>Pachelbel's Canon finally draws to an end. You aren't sad at all to see it finally 
          draw its final pained breaths for the day, and with the speed at which the other 
          four members of your ensemble are packing up, you aren't alone.</p>
          
        <p>Some old guy in a suit sweeps into the front of the room, microphone in hand, and 
          starts speaking Chinese. You aren't sure what he's saying, but you've been to enough of 
          these auctions that you know he's probably introducing the piece and donor. (You didn't 
          bother cramming DuoLingo before your ensemble flew out here, because three out of the 
          five of you speak Chinese, and you can barely manage English.)</p>
          
        <p>{{name}} is eyeing the piece on display with a disconcerting amount of focus.</p>
        
        <p>"You like the piece?" You ask, a little curious about anything that can hold {{name}}'s 
          attention so closely.</p>
          
        <p>"Hm," {{name}} says. "It's certainly interesting."</p>
        
        <p>Well, that's an incredibly suspicious answer. "Interesting how?"</p>
        
        <p>"Tell you later," {{name}} says. "You gonna pack up, or are you gonna carry your 
          instrument for the rest of the afternoon?"</p>
          
        <p>Ah. Yeah. No, thank you. You've already carried this quintet for the last 2 hours.</p>
        
        <p>You and {{name}} wave the other three goodbye as they slip into the next section of the 
          museum.</p>
          
        <p>The man on the microphone hands the mic off to some college-looking kid standing next 
          to him with stark white hair. (Not platinum blond. White.) You knew some kids in high 
          school with scarily light hair, but this guy's too dark for it to be natural.</p>
          
        <p>You don't catch a word of what anyone's saying because you don't speak the language. 
          {{name}} doesn't catch a word of what anyone's saying, because {{subPro}}'s too busy 
          leaning over to stage-whisper at you.</p>
          
        <p>"He's got a weird accent," {{subPro}} says. "Probably one of those old-money European 
          donors. That kid with the red hair in the front row keeps mouthing stuff when he 
          stumbles over words, so she's probably his interpreter."</p>
          
        <p>You can barely see the girl {{subPro}}'s referring to from where the both of you are 
          sitting. (She's definitely not white, and her hair probably isn't natural, either.)</p>
          
        <p>"That's pretty impressive," you say. "How'd you figure that one out?"</p>
        
        <p>"I'm stupid, not deaf."</p>
        
        <p>"Yeah? When's my birthday?"</p>
        
        <p>"Why would I know that?"</p>
        
        <p>"I told you on the way here."</p>
        
        <p>"I don't even know my own birthday. You think I know yours?"</p>
        
        <p>{{name}}'s phone vibrates before you can get a word in edgewise.</p>
        
        <p>"Oh, sorry," {{subPro}} says, whipping {{posAdj}} phone out of the pocket it's doing 
          an impression of a blender in. "It's from a colleague. I need to take this."</p>
          
        <p>"Go ahead," you say flatly. You already know it's from your bassist.</p>
        
        <p>{{name}} flashes you an innocent smile that definitely promises a terribad plan taking 
          shape in {{posAdj}} mind before stepping out.</p>
          
        <p>The guy in the suit is back on the mic, which is a shame. You think the kid with bright 
          white hair is pretty funky, and you understand both of them equally well anyway.</p>
          
        <p>You get all of thirty seconds of respite before the fire alarms go off.</p>
        
        <p>The crowd of art snobs loses its collective mind scrambling for the exit. You've 
          never seen a folding chair get so much airtime. That's probably a record.</p>
          
        <p>Oh, wait. You should probably stop acting so calm, because you're not supposed to 
          know {{name}} almost definitely set the alarms off with a smuggled canister of Axe body spray 
          and a dollar store lighter.</p>
          
        <p>You do your best impression of panicking art snob on your way out of the building 
          (instrument case in hand, because you're not leaving a $16,000 instrument unattended, 
          fake fire panic or no) and ever-so-conveniently run into {{name}}.</p>
          
        <p>"Wow, someone sure sprayed a whole lot of Axe in the bathroom," {{subPro}} says ever-
          so-casually.</p>
          
        <p>"Why can't you use hairspray like a normal person?" You ask, voice low (and American) 
          to keep anyone from arresting the two of you on the spot.</p>
          
        <p>"Not my style," {{name}} says. "Hey, isn't that the donor?"</p>
        
        <p>You tear your gaze from what looks suspiciously like a burn on {{name}}'s fingers to 
          stare in the direction {{subPro}}'s looking in. Sure enough, it's the guy with the 
          crazy white hair and his crazy red-haired friend.</p>
          
        <p>They're startlingly calm for the situation, lounging on the grass like the museum 
          they were auctioning a possibly priceless piece of art in isn't on fire. (Well, yeah, 
          okay, it isn't, but they don't know that.)</p>
          
        <p>{{name}}, rather than moving on with {{posAdj}} life, walks straight up to the two of 
          them, dragging you along for the ride.</p>
          
        <p>You aren't surprised to watch {{objPro}} launch into a full conversation with the girl, 
          leaving you trying to look anywhere but at the guy with the funky hair. He seems 
          rather unfazed by the fact that he's sitting in the grass in a tailored suit, and that 
          either means he's the coolest filthy rich kid you will ever have the pleasure of trying 
          not to stare at or the snobbiest. Spoiled-est? Is that a word?</p>
          
        <p>"Oh, English?" {{name}} says out of nowhere, glancing at suit kid.</p>
        
        <p>Suit kid blinks up at {{objPro}}. "Only if I have to."</p>
        
        <p>Oh. Perfect American accent.</p>
        
        <p>"You can always speak Taiwanese instead," the girl with red hair says.</p>
        
        <p>"Pass."</p>
        
        <p>"You're Ben, then?" {{name}} says. "I'm {{name}} {{surname}}, and this--" {{subPro}} 
          waves a hand in your direction. "--is <span class="givenName">Alice</span> 
          <span class="familyName">Yu</span>, the other violinist."</p>
          
        <p>"The 'other' violinist?" You scoff.</p>
        
        <p>"Anyway, I saw your Renoir," {{name}} says, completely ignoring your existence. What 
          are friends for, and all that. "Quite impressive."</p>
          
        <p>"Thank you," Ben says politely.</p>
        
        <p>{{name}} isn't done, because {{subPro}} can never leave a compliment a compliment. 
          "You should probably use a yellow with better lightfastness next time, though."</p>
          
        <p>"I have no idea what you're talking about," Ben says flatly. You also have no idea 
          what {{name}} is talking about, but not in an evasive way. You just flat-out have no 
          idea what half of the words {{subPro}} said mean.</p>
          
        <p>Red-haired kid is looking incredibly offended, though. Ben remains unperturbed, 
          but you're a little worried about how he's reaching into his suit jacket.</p>
          
        <p>"Uh, {{name}}," you say, not quite sure how to diffuse the situation, and definitely
          not in the frame of mind to be dodging bullets, figurative or literal.</p>
          
        <p>Ben pulls his hand back out and opens it. There are a few pieces of wrapped candy 
          sitting in his palm.</p>
          
        <p>"Want some?" He asks.</p>
        
        <p>"Um. No, thank you," you say.</p>
        
        <p>He shrugs and rips the wrapper off one, popping the candy in his mouth.</p>
        
        <p>"Anyway," {{name}} says, because, again, {{subPro}} has no idea when enough is enough. 
          "Who forged it?"</p>
          
        <p>Forged?</p>
        
        <p>The red-haired girl looks like she's planning to jump {{name}} in a dark alley, but 
          Ben says "Me."</p>
          
        <p>"Ben," red-haired girl says, steel in her voice.</p>
        
        <p>"Whatever. It was ugly, anyway," Ben says. "Why do you want to know, {{surname}}?"</p>
        
        <p>"If you're just looking for cash, you can outsource the con," {{name}} says far too 
          loudly. "Have you considered working on a team before?"</p>
          
        <p>"<i>We</i> are a team," red-haired girl growls.</p>
        
        <p>"Yeah," Ben says. "We're majoring in screwing with the fine art scene. 5 more credits 
          until the FBI shows up on my ugly apartment doorstep and shoots me through the head 
          for crimes against French Impressionism."</p>
          
        <p>The rest of your quintet stumbles onto the scene exactly then. Your cellist, still 
          obviously half-asleep, stumbles on the pavement, and the vase the five of you were hired 
          to steal almost falls out of her case and onto the pavement.</p>
          
        <p>You all sit in a mildly uncomfortable silence for a few seconds longer than socially 
          acceptable.</p>
          
        <p>"How much is membership?" Ben asks. "I have 3 bucks in my bank account."</p>
