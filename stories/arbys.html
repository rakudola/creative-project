    <h2 id="ch1-begin">Chapter 1</h2>
    
    <p>There's no good way to explain the sound the car door makes when you slam it shut, but the 
        way it ricochets through your skull like nails on a chalkboard probably has more to do 
        with the cold syrup you're dangerously close to overdosing on layered on top of the fever 
        you're running than the actual sound it makes.</p>
        
    <p>Is the engine off? You hope the engine is off. Everything's kinda blurry, and the janky 
        street lights on this side of town don't light up the cracked asphalt enough.</p>
        
    <p>You shuffle the contents of your pockets. You haven't washed these jeans since middle 
        school, but you haven't worn them since then, either. Digging through your pockets 
        numbly might as well require a PhD in paleontology with the amount of work your brain 
        can do while trying to fry itself. You can't identify half the garbage in there right now, 
        but you do manage to pull out the most recent addition to the landfill in your pocket. 
        It's smoother in your hand than the crumpled-up science worksheets from 8th grade.</p>
        
    <p>The door to the place is across the parking lot, but you're not in the mood for food right 
        now. Maybe never, with the way your stomach's still attempting seppuku.</p>
        
    <p>No. You're interested in what's standing behind the greasy fast food joint, cigarette 
        stuffed between his lips and sunglasses hiding absolutely nothing.</p>
    
    <p>"Hey," you say, swaying in place a bit, probably. Your hands are back in your pockets.</p>
    
    <p>He spares you a glance.</p>
    
    <p>"Smoking's..." Your mouth doesn't feel like doing words right now. Your tongue's just 
        kinda flopping everywhere. "Smoking's bad for you, you know?"</p>
        
    <p>The guy pulls the cigarette out of his mouth to say, unsurprisingly, "What's your 
        problem?"</p>
        
    <p>"Not--Not as bad as--" You yank your hand out of your pocket. "--this, though."</p>
    
    <p>You aim for between his eyes, but he sidesteps easily. Your knife hits the wall.</p>
    
    <p>He grabs for your knife arm. He doesn't get it, but you've just overbalanced, and now 
        you're faceplanting into concrete.</p>
        
    <p>He steps on your knife hand and crushes it beneath his heel.</p>
    
    <p>"Who are you supposed to be?" He says very casually and not at all like some psychopath 
        on six different cold drugs just tried to stab him with a steak knife.</p>
        
    <p>"Like--Like you care," you say.</p>
    
    <p>He twists his heel into your wrist, which would probably be more concerning if you were 
        capable of feeling anything other than the migraine building behind your eyes.</p>
        
    <p>"I tend to care when someone tries to stab me."</p>
    
    <p>For some reason, your brain short-circuits and smacks the "hysterical laughter" button. 
        That's what it took? A knife threat?</p>
        
    <p>Your head's too fuzzy to remember what you even came here for, who this guys is, why you 
        tried to knife-fight him behind a broken-down Arby's. You know, somewhere, but right now, 
        it's just fever aches and cold syrup and the fuzzy but violent impression that this guy's 
        the reason you've been living out of your car.</p>
        
    <p>You might have puked on his shoes before you passed out. You don't remember. You hope you 
        did.</p>
        
    <hr />
    
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <p>Of course, you aren't actually aware you passed out until you wake up on a couch you don't 
        recognize in an apartment you don't recognize with a view you unfortunately recognize 
        very well.</p>
        
    <p>Seoul.</p>
    
    <p>Welcome home, you think bitterly, except that also reminds you that you live in a car, and 
        Seoul has jack-all street parking, so, uh, where's your car?</p>
        
    <p>"Hey."</p>
    
    <p>You turn your head blearily and try to sit up, but that all compounds into a throbbing 
        headache that leaves you with some serious nausea, so you stop doing the sitting-up 
        thing.</p>
        
    <p>"Who are you?" You croak. You sound awful. You've been sick the past few days, right? 
        Didn't you buy some of those nasty generic-brand convenience store medicines for that? 
        Those better still be in your car.</p>
        
    <p>"Better question: who are you, and why'd you try to stab Jungle Cook?"</p>
    
    <p>What.</p>
    
    <p>You chance a glance at the guy interrogating you. He's kinda curled in on himself on an 
        armchair opposite you, but he's sounding pretty confident for someone who just accused 
        you of trying to stab someone. You don't know who he is, though.</p>
        
    <p>Wait--stab? Jungle Cook? "What?"</p>
    
    <p>"Last night," the guy says, eyes narrowing. You're not sure if it's supposed to look 
        threatening or something, but if it is, it's kind of lost on the fact that he looks 
        twelve. "Jungle Cook--He's the biggest name in the industry--"</p>
        
    <p>"I know who Jungle Cook is." You trip over his stupid nickname, still very sick and not 
        in the mood for English phonetics, but that doesn't matter. You very much know who he is, 
        because he and the rest of that stupid QX group ruined the career you'd spent years 
        working and networking for. Your dream, your genius, your vision, down the drain in barely 
        24 hours, and oops, the guy's talking again.</p>
        
    <p>"You tried to stab him last night," he says. "Behind an Arby's. Also, I'm pretty sure you 
        stole a car."</p>
        
    <p>"What," you say again, because you're pretty sure you wouldn't be living out of the tin can 
        of a car under your name if you knew how to steal cars. Also, there's still the matter of 
        you apparently trying to kill Jungle Cook. You've had incredibly detailed fantasies about 
        it, sure, but you don't own a knife that isn't a butterknife and also plastic.</p>
        
    <p>The guy fixes you with another look you can't read. Irritation? Fear? Constipation?</p>
    
    <p>He doesn't say anything, though, and you'd like to not be here, preferably immediately.</p>
    
    <p>"I think you have the wrong person," you say.</p>
    
    <p>"You threw up on his shoes," the guy says.</p>
    
    <p>"That proves nothing."</p>
    
    <p>He doesn't bother gracing that one with a response. That's... yeah. Fair.</p>
    
    <p>"Look," you say. Your head's still swimming, but maybe your fever's gone down(?). "I'm 
        sick, I live in a car, and I haven't eaten anything but chips for a week. If you want 
        money, I don't have any."</p>
        
    <p>The door opens. Even with the stupidly conspicuous disguise of a hoodie over sunglasses 
        and a face mask, it's pretty obvious it's Jungle Cook. You think you should be angry 
        at the sight of him for ruining your life, but mostly you just feel sick and miserable. 
        And hungry.</p>
        
    <p>"We don't want your money," he says, pulling the hood and sunglasses off in one movement. 
        "We want your experience."</p>
        
    <p>"My what." Experience of living in a car? You're looking forward to seeing it again for the 
        first time in a long time.</p>
        
    <p>"You clawed your way up the ladder to managing one of the biggest groups in the industry," 
        Jungle Cook says, glaring at you. He's very handsome. You wonder how he would look with a 
        broken nose. "Pretty impressive before you tanked it."</p>
        
    <p>"Shut it." You don't have the energy to argue right now. Or ever.</p>
    
    <p>"We're taking the industry apart," the other guy on the couch blurts. "We want your 
        help."</p>
        
    <p>Uh.</p>
    
    <p>What?</p>
    
    <p>Jungle Cook turns his glare to couch dude. "Look, <span class="givenName">Dae Seong</span> 
        is too stupid for this. Just press charges so we can go."</p>
        
    <p>Uh, press charges? Again, you have no money. "No. No, what are you talking about, 
        taking the industry apart?"</p>
        
    <p>"We're taking it apart," couch guy says again, unhelpfully.</p>
    
    <p>You are so tired.</p>
    
    <p>"Aggressive corporate sabotage," Jungle Cook clarifies. "Since you're good at that."</p>
    
    <p>"Whatever." Everything hurts. You just want to sleep. "Sure. Sign me up."</p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <p>You wake up on a couch feeling marginally better. Your memories of the last couch you 
        woke up on (and the room it was in) were already fuzzy at best and are fading fast, 
        but you're pretty sure this one is a different couch in a different room.</p>
        
    <p>"This sucks," you mutter to no one in particular.</p>
    
    <p>"Sh," someone hisses at you.</p>
    
    <p>It's dark. The only source of light in the room is the TV playing some (captioned) drama 
        at the lowest possible volume. You can faintly make out the couch dude from the last time 
        you woke up on a couch curled up in an armchair next to you in the flickering TV light.</p>
        
    <p>There's a clock on the coffee table in front of you. It's 2:15 AM.</p>
    
    <p>You have a blanket on you. That's nice. "Shouldn't you be asleep?"</p>
    
    <p>Couch guy hits you with a glare. It's reminiscent of a sad panda.</p>
    
    <p>"He should be," another voice chimes, and the TV flicks off as the lights flick on. 
        Couch guy hisses again.</p>
        
    <p>A woman moves in front of the TV, decked out in what you're pretty sure is a foreign-brand 
        ensemble worth a nice car. It's a terrible outfit. You don't have the heart or enough 
        neurons unburned by your fever to tell her that.</p>
        
    <p>Couch guy whines about his drama. Rich lady with terrible fashion sense ignores him.</p>
    
    <p>"I take it you're <span class="givenName">Dae Seong</span> 
        <span class="familyName">Jeon</span>," she says. "Welcome to Shik Noona."</p>
        
    <p>"No." Absolutely not. You barely escaped the music industry with your life intact. You're 
        not getting involved with another big-name group. No.</p>
        
    <p>Poorly dressed lady cocks an eyebrow at you. Her makeup's pretty good, at least. "Alright, 
        we'll see you in court in five to ten business days for assaulting Jungle Cook."</p>
        
    <p>"Nevermind." You're still pretty sure you didn't do that. You also still would like to go 
        back to your car and your sad stash of chips.</p>
        
    <p>"Glad to see we're on the same page." She flicks the remote towards couch kid, but her eyes 
        don't leave you. "Si Woo, get the new recruit something to eat."</p>
        
    <p>Couch guy, who you guess is named Si Woo, glares (pouts?) at you one last time before 
        wandering off to what you assume is the door to the kitchen.</p>
        
    <p>"Recruit?" You ask, suddenly aware you should probably be sitting up. You do that. You 
        don't almost puke this time.</p>
        
    <p>"Not as an idol." The woman smiles and takes a seat on the armchair Si Woo hadn't been in. 
        There's nothing behind her eyes. "Big Sister thinks you would be better suited 
        elsewhere."</p>
        
    <p>Uh. Yeah. Is that not supposed to be 16 levels of ominous? "Who?"</p>
    
    <p>"The CEO and president."</p>
    
    <p>Ah.</p>
    
    <p>Shik Noona is under the MUJIN Entertainment label, founded in China. Despite all of your 
        research efforts, you couldn't find a name or face for the CEO. You thought it was a weird 
        move, especially where stockholders were concerned, but after having your own name 
        plastered across every screen in Korea, you think you understand.</p>
        
    <p>"What does she want from me?" In the business world, you have to move blindly. But you're 
        not in the business world anymore, and you've lived out of your car for too long to take 
        any more risks like the one you took with QX again.</p>
        
    <p>"How would you like a second shot at being a manager?"</p>
    
    <p>"No." Your resume currently contains the bullet points "Set a world record for 
        shortest-lived manager career" and "Pushed company stocks so low the entire label went 
        bankrupt." You don't want to touch that position ever again. You don't even want to be 
        here. You want to jump off a bridge and let the world sort itself out without you here to 
        ruin your own life.</p>
        
    <p>"That wasn't a request," the woman says, steel behind the fake cheer in her voice. "You owe 
        us for the car you stole, and we're keeping your little knife trick behind that Arby's 
        under tight wraps. We frown upon making threats here, but you aren't in a position to pay 
        us back or keep yourself out of jail if any news of this leaks out."</p>
        
    <p>You get the feeling she specifically isn't mentioning what's going to happen if you try 
        to run.</p>
        
    <p>Look, you just wanted to be a manager. You had all these plans and ideas to make QX the 
        biggest group since sliced bread, and look where that got you. You can't go out in public. 
        You can't get an apartment. You're sick, you're tired, and you're done. You're done.</p>
        
    <p>"If you don't want to be a manager anymore," she says like this was her plan all along. 
        "Then how about a producer?"</p>
        
    <p>"A what."</p>
    
    <p>"We saw some of your ideas for QX," she says. "We desperately need a manager for the S 
        Group--" That would be the male division of Shik Noona, some old excerpt you read a year 
        ago whispers. "--but if you won't take that, we could use your vision and drive as a 
        producer."</p>
        
    <p>"I can't write music." You really can't. You don't even know how to read music. You picked 
        up clarinet for a month in middle school and wanted to cry the entire time.</p>
        
    <p>"We'll be modifying the job description severely." The woman stands up from her seat. "I'll 
        draft a proposal and come back after you eat and get some sleep."</p>
        
    <p>Si Woo kicks the door open exactly then, a bowl of instant ramen in his hands.</p>
    
    <p>It's only after Si Woo barely avoids spilling the entire thing on the carpet and the woman 
        is out the door that you realize you have no idea what her name is. You hope you don't get 
        quizzed on it later.</p>
