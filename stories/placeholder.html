    <h2 id="ch1-begin">Chapter 1</h2>
    
    <p>You have had 1 (one) customer come in so far today.</p>
    
    <p>The weather can't decide if it's (freezing) raining or not, which never means good things for business. 
      Cafes toeing the border between the town and the ooky spooky forest get regulars, sure, but 
      most of them pop in in the morning, order their coffee black with 12 shots of espresso, 
      and walk out in under five minutes without another word. Nobody wanders around the edge of 
      town and pops into some random cafe when the sky might decide to unleash frozen divine
      judgement on the unsuspecting townsfolk at any second.</p>
      
    <p>Except for this dude.</p>
    
    <p>"Morning," he chirps, not at all phased by the rainwater sliding down his face. There's ice
      in his hair. "Nice weather today, isn't it?"</p>
      
    <p>You can't tell if that's sarcasm or not, so you slap a smile on your face and make some
      noise you hope is agreeable enough that he orders something.</p>
      
    <p>He hums and scans the menu behind you. His eyes are closed. (He hasn't opened them since he walked in.)</p>
    
    <p>"In the mood for something hot?" You ask. It's nothing conversation worthy, but you 
      hadn't expected any customers until the weather clears up a bit, and anyone walking 
      around outside in this weather isn't in their right mind. Or sober.</p>
      
    <p>The guy tilts his head, still staring pensively at the menu through closed eyelids.</p>
    
    <p>His movement lets you catch a glimpse of a literal eagle perched on one of your chairs outside. It's 
      deep brown with golden accents, chilling under a table umbrella, and staring straight at you.</p>
      
    <p>Yeah, you're not liking this entire situation one bit. Have you mildly inconvenienced any fae recently?</p>
    
    <p>"Ah, can I have a green tea lemonade, please?" He asks with a smile.</p>
    
    <p>"That's an iced drink," you say, mind going a thousand miles a minute. This guy walks in in 
      this weather and wants an iced drink? He's either on every drug ever invented, or he's 
      with the (is a?) fae. Neither option bodes well for you. "Do you want me to warm it up for 
      you?"</p>
      
    <p>"No, thank you," he says. "Iced is fine."</p>
    
    <p>You get the distinct feeling that your days are numbered. Like, in the single digits numbered.</p>
    
    <p>"Anything else?"</p>
    
    <p>The eagle's still staring at you through the window.</p>
    
    <p>"No, that's it for the moment, thanks."</p>
    
    <p>The rain picks up again, pelting the windows. The eagle seems unconcerned.</p>
    
    <p>"Can I get a name for the order?"</p>
    
    <p>"Sure. It's Ren."</p>
    
    <p>"Alright, I'll have your drink ready in a few minutes."</p>
    
    <p>You turn around to busy yourself with an iced green tea lemonade and hope to whoever might 
      possibly be listening that this guy just wants to come in, get his iced tea, and leave.</p>
      
    <p>Predictably, whoever is listening laughs at you.</p>
    
    <p>"Sorry, one more thing," Ren says, sounding genuinely apologetic, and you're already 
      wondering why the last thing you sent your mom was a Spongebob gif. You're going out on a 
      Spongebob gif.</p>
      
    <p>"Yeah?" You ask, turning around a little more slowly than the situation probably dictates.</p>
    
    <p>He's still smiling, but his head's between you and the eagle again. "I need some magic help."</p>
    
    <p>Oh, son of a gun, he's an undercover cop. Of course he is.</p>
    
    <p>"Magic?" You raise an eyebrow for dramatically confused effect. "We took the Magic Macchiato 
      off the menu in April, sorry."</p>
      
    <p>"That sounds lovely, but also like the sugar content might kill me." The smile slips off 
      his face. "But, no, I wasn't talking about that. You already know that."</p>
      
    <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," you say. He probably doesn't have a warrant. 
      Maybe your mom was right about networking with lawyers.</p>
      
    <p>His eyes snap open, and <i>ooh</i> that's not a human color. Yeah, you messed 
      this one up big time.</p>
    
    <p>"<span class="givenName">Lucia</span> <span class="familyName">Cafaro</span>," he says. 
      "Known by the entire Salerno magical legal enforcement due to constant scrapes with 
      the Masquerade Act, renowned throughout Campania for genius if unorthodox magical 
      innovation, arrested at least three times and eventually banned from your home country 
      for illegal spell synthesis. I believe you know what I'm talking about."</p>
      
    <p>It's hard to keep your voice neutral when you're aware this guy is probably about to 
      squash you like a bug for your human insolence, but you still manage a "That's me."</p>
      
    <p>He smiles at you again, eyes sliding shut.</p>
    
    <p>"Oh, good, because this would be awkward otherwise." He slams a bag you hadn't seen him 
      bring in on the counter and opens it. There's an obscene amount of money inside. You're 
      pretty sure you could buy a small country with the amount of cold cash sparkling at you 
      from Ren's ugly brown bag.</p>
      
    <p>"What," you say, because you genuinely no longer have any idea what is happening.</p>
    
    <p>"I can give you this much, if that's okay," he says like he offered you five bucks and 
      not the entire Federal Reserve.</p>
      
    <p>"For what?"</p>
    
    <p>"Could you help me kidnap a kid, please?"</p>

        <a href="#ch1-refuse"><button class="col-button">Point-blank refuse</button></a>
        <a href="#ch1-agree"><button class="col-button">Agree to help (tentatively)</button></a>
      </div>
      <hr />
    
    <h3 id="ch1-refuse">Point-blank refuse</h3>
    
    <p>"No," you say firmly. "I don't know who you are, I don't know what your motives are, 
      and I'm not kidnapping a kid."</p>
    
    <p>Ren shrugs. "I get it. I hope you understand I can't leave you with this knowledge, 
      though."</p>
      
    <p>You don't know what that means.</p>
    
    <p>You wake up with your clock reading 1:39 PM and promptly freak out, because you fell 
      asleep yesterday just fine and can't imagine why you woke up so late. Your cafe was 
      closed through the entire morning rush!</p>
      
    <p>The sound of rain pelting your windows fades into your peripherals. Has it been 
      raining all day? Business is pretty slow when it rains. Maybe you didn't miss too 
      much.</p>
      
    <p>It was sunny yesterday morning. At least you were awake for that.</p>
    
    <p>The TV's running in the background a few years later when the leaders of that Olive Branch 
      thief ring get arrested. You manage to catch that one is named Sy Lin, and the other's 
      got a name so long the display can't fit it. Everyone calls him "Ren."</p>
      
    <p>You feel like you've forgotten something when their mugshots flash across the screen. 
      Ren's eyes are closed, for some reason. Maybe you saw them in the street at some point.</p>
      
    <p>You move to slam the next order on the counter. No use worrying about it now.</p>
    
    <p>You never catch news on either of them again.</p>

    <h3 id="ch1-agree">Agree to help (tentatively)</h3>
    
    <p>"Can I <i>what</i>," you ask, like a normal person. Your eyes are still on the bag before 
      you, though. That's a whole lotta dough. (People still say that, right? You're not that 
      old...)</p>
    
    <p>"Help me kidnap a kid," he says cheerily. "Orâ€”us, I guess. My partner and I. We haven't 
      done this on purpose before."</p>
      
    <p>Uh-huh. Yeah. Does that mean they've done it on accident? "Can I get some more 
      details?"</p>
      
    <p>"I can bring my partner and the specs in tomorrow," he says, fishing a business card out 
      of his jacket and holding it out to you. "If you have any specific questions today, though, 
      I can answer them right now."</p>
      
    <p>You take his card. You have a whole lot of questions.</p>
    
    <p>You finally settle for "Why?"</p>
    
    <p>"You're good at disabling security systems." He's still smiling. "And neither of us are 
      any good at magic. Our old specialist dropped out to get a job with better health insurance 
      benefits."</p>
      
    <p>"Not me. The kid."</p>
    
    <p>"Oh, a contact called in a favor."</p>
    
    <p>He says that, still grinning, like it answers the question. Well, okay, it does answer the 
      question you asked. It just raises a whole lot of other questions with it.</p>
      
    <p>You take a glance at the business card. It's a piece of cardstock with "Ren" scrawled 
      across the front in Sharpie, a phone number you're pretty sure won't work in a week, 
      and "If lost, return to Sy â˜º" written on the back.</p>
      
    <p>You look back up. "What are you doing with this kid?"</p>
    
    <p>"Hm." Ren looks a little too pensive at that question. "The plan is to ship him to our 
      contact, but now that I'm saying that out loud, I'm not sure I can handle being in a car 
      with a twelve year old for that long."</p>
      
    <p>You try to school your face into something that doesn't radiate your feelings on that 
      statement. It works so poorly that the guy standing several feet away from you with his eyes 
      closed picks up on it.</p>
      
    <p>"I'm not that bad of a driver," he huffs.</p>
    
    <p>He's just going to say whatever he wants whenever he wants, huh?</p>
    
    <p>"Anyways, if that's it for today," he says. "Could I still get that green tea, please?"</p>
    
    <p>You're a bit scared the bag of money he dumped on your counter is going to fade into fairy 
      dust in a few hours, or something, but the cash he hands you for his drink is definitely 
      actual legal tender. (Well, it still might be forged, but it's not magically forged.)</p>
      
    <p>He walks out the door with a "see you tomorrow" and a friendly wave, eyes still closed, and 
      struts away with his iced green tea in one hand and the eagle that was staring at you the 
      entire time perched on the other.</p>
      
    <p>It's still raining. Neither Ren nor the eagle seem to mind.</p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Under construction. Read at your own risk.</strong></p>
    
    <p>The weather's still miserable when Ren walks in again, this time behind some guy in so many 
      layers you can't see the bottom of his face. At least he has an umbrella.</p>
      
    <p>"We should've moved to Florida," says the dude with at least three jackets on.</p>
    
    <p>"Hurricane insurance," Ren says. He's in the same jacket he was wearing yesterday, and now 
      that you're getting a good look at it, it's barely more than a thin hoodie. Why do neither 
      of these people know how many layers are appropriate for the weather?</p>
      
    <p>Ren's eagle is back to its perch, this time craning its neck to look at things that aren't 
      you. It's a small comfort. You'll take what you can get.</p>
      
    <p>The dude in three jacketsâ€”nope, just kidding, there's another sweaterâ€”politely closes his 
      umbrella in a fashion that does not get water all over your floor and approaches the counter 
      with his eyes open. You know, like a sensible person.</p>
      
    <p>"Morning," he chirps. "Awful weather today, isn't it?"</p>
      
    <p>What an awfully familiar greeting. "Not my favorite, no."</p>
    
    <p>He grins at you and starts scanning the menu. "You're <span class="givenName">Lucia</span> 
      <span class="familyName">Cafaro</span>, then?"</p>
      
    <p>"I am. You are?"</p>
    
    <p>"Sy Lin. Nice to meet you."</p>
    
    <p>"Pleasure's mine. What can I get for you today?"</p>
    
    <p>Sy puts a hand to his chin in deep thought, as is necessary for choosing a flavor of coffee.</p>
    
    <p>"Can I get a hot chocolate?" He looks over his shoulder at Ren, who's already sitting at a 
      table, and says something that definitely is not in any language you speak. "What do you 
      want?"</p>
      
    <p>"Green tea, please," Ren says.</p>
    
    <p>"That's iced."</p>
    
    <p>"Yeah."</p>
    
    <p>"You're gonna get sick."</p>
    
    <p>"That's not how pathogens work."</p>
    
    <p>Sy is not listening. Sy is already ripping a jacket off and stalking towards Ren.</p>
    
    <p>You're, uh, not entirely sure what to do about two dudes screaming (in politely low tones) 
      at each other about jackets and pathogen pathways, so you start the definitely confirmed 
      hot chocolate instead of worrying about it.</p>
