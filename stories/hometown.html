    <h2 id="ch1-begin">Chapter 1</h2>
    
    <p>You know what? You've made some dumb decisions in the past. That's a fair statement. You 
        totaled your mom's car in high school, you almost failed out of university, you graduated 
        with a useless degree and wandered into Taiwan to teach English even though you didn't 
        know a single word of Mandarin. Whatever. You figured it out. Life keeps moving.</p>
        
    <p>This, though? This whole situation is—</p>
    
    <p>"Hey," the middle schooler in the passenger seat says, a smile across 
        his face as he taps a finger on the gun he's got pressed to your temple. "Are you working 
        with Tanaka or not?" Perfect English.</p>
        
    <p>You're glad you're in the backseat, because Mark—the only friend from high school you've 
        kept in touch with—looks like he's about to pass out, too. Solidarity.</p>
        
    <p>"I—I didn't know what was in the bag," you stutter out, because that seems like the real 
        issue this kid and the lady driving have with you: something's in the bag that Mr. 
        Tien-chung (your very polite neighbor who helped you move in and brought you bread) asked 
        you to take to his friend, and also there's a middle schooler with bright blue hair 
        holding a gun to your head what is happening why is this happening?!</p>
        
    <p>"Oh, that's nice!" He chirps. "I don't care! Answer the question." </p>
    
    <p>The lady at the wheel jerks the car past the railing, and now you're all careening down 
        a mountain in some tin can of a car, and if this kid and his gun don't kill you, the final 
        impact probably will.</p>
        
    <p>The gun leaves your head by the grace of the laws of physics alone.</p>
    
    <p>Mark pulls a Ring Pop out of his pocket. He's crying.</p>
    
    <p>"Will you marry me?"</p>
    
    <p>"What?"</p>
    
    <p>"I don't wanna die single!"</p>
    
    <p>"You're engaged!!"</p>
    
    <p>The car slams to a stop. The seatbelt slams into your chest, inertia knocking the wind out 
      of you.</p>
      
    <p>You barely get a second to gasp for air before the kid in the front seat has his gun 
      trained on the both of you again, that cheerful smile still on his face.</p>
      
    <p>"Get out of my car," he says cheerily. "We're stopping here for lunch!"</p>
    
    <p>You unbuckle the seatbelt and get out of the car. The kid's staring Mark down like a hawk, 
      and the lady that was driving is watching your every move. She probably has a gun on her 
      person. You'd rather not find out.</p>
      
    <p>You glance around.</p>
    
    <p>Wait. You know this place.</p>
    
    <p>The restaurant you're in front of is one you frequent, actually. It's tiny and run by one 
      of the coolest guys you've ever made friends with. The guy's barely out of high school and 
      trying to support his siblings, and, well, you probably should've known that this thing 
      was a mafia front. Somehow. Why is this happening to you? Is this karmic retribution from 
      a past life?</p>
      
    <p>Mark sidles up to you under the careful watch of whatever triad members just herded you 
      out of their car.</p>
      
    <p>"What's the weather like in <span class="currentCity">Springville</span>?" You ask. You're 
      not sure why. Maybe you're just homesick and also acutely aware that you probably won't 
      see your apartment again, much less your hometown.</p>
      
    <p>"<span class="tianqiTemp">54</span> Fahrenheit, <span class="tianqiDesc">light 
      rain</span>," he says, and you know he hasn't had an opportunity to check recently. How 
      does he do it?</p>
      
    <p>You march into the restaurant to Chia-wei's standard giant grin and "Hey, good to see you. 
      What can I—"</p>
      
    <p>And then he sees the psychopaths trail in behind you.</p>
    
    <p>"—get for you," he finishes. You aren't great at subtler hints in this language yet, but 
      it's not hard to tell he's less than pleased.</p>
      
    <p>"Oh, the usual," Mr. Middle Schooler says pleasantly, easily slipping into Mandarin.</p>
      
    <p>Chia-wei points at you and Mark, eyes still glued to the kid with blue hair. "Those two 
      aren't in on anything. They can barely find their way around town. What's wrong with 
      you?"</p>
      
    <p>The lady who was driving is behind you, so you don't see so much as feel the death glare 
      she sends at Chia-wei. The temperature drops a few degrees. You're not sure if you're glad 
      that the place is empty or not.</p>
      
    <p>"I would hardly call moving drugs for Tanaka 'not in on anything,'" the kid shoots back. 
      "Do you still serve youtiao?"</p>
      
    <p>"Of course. Stop messing with the foreigners and I'll give you extra."</p>
    
    <p>"Only if they tell me what I want to know!"</p>
    
    <p>Chia-wei's dropped his smile by this point, opting for a face loudly signaling 
      a migraine. "And you've gotten a whole lot of useful information out of them already, 
      right?"</p>
      
    <p>"Hm... I know what the weather is in <span class="currentCity">Springville</span>!" 
      Another big smile.</p>
      
    <p>"Look, Haruki, they probably just thought they were doing a favor." Chia-wei's pinching 
      his nose bridge. "If you want actual information, you've just let Tanaka know you're after 
      him, and now he's probably on the next flight to Korea."</p>
      
    <p>Haruki pouts thoughtfully. "Hm. Yeah. That makes sense."</p>
    
    <p>Chia-wei pulls his fingers away from his face, mild confusion painted on it. "What, you're 
      not gonna argue?"</p>
      
    <p>Haruki shrugs. "We've been on this for three months, and I'm running out of vacation days. 
      I really just want this entire thing over and done with."</p>
      
    <p>"And it didn't occur to you that these two were probably in contact with Tanaka before you 
      stuffed them in your car at gunpoint?"</p>
      
    <p>"I've slept a grand total of 12 hours this past week," the woman finally says. "Can we 
      get our food and leave?"</p>
      
    <p>"Please do," Chia-wei says.</p>
    
    <p>She rattles off her and Haruki's orders. Chia-wei gives her the minimum needed attention 
      before turning to you and Mark, exhausted but friendly smile back in place.</p>
      
    <p>"Mark, <span class="givenName">Cam</span>, what can I get you two? And don't worry about 
      paying." He jerks a thumb at the actual mafia members that he just lectured. "They can 
      cover it."</p>
      
    <p>"Yeah! It's on me," the <i>middle schooler</i>, in a uniform you easily recognize as the 
      one three blocks from your apartment complex, says, pulling one of those insane VIP 
      Golden Luxe Exclusive credit cards out of who-know-where like he wasn't holding a gun to 
      your head seven minutes ago.</p>
      
    <p>"Uh," you say, something vaguely resembling etiquette trying to kick in. "You—You don't 
      have to—"</p>
      
    <p>"I'm not Taiwanese. Don't play that etiquette game with me." He slides the card towards 
      Chia-wei. "It's an apology, anyway."</p>
      
    <p>Chia-wei pretty much hovers over you and Mark for the rest of the meal, chatting about 
      whatever, until Haruki and the lady whose name you don't know start packing up to leave.</p>
      
    <p>Well, Chia-wei still stands there, because Haruki walks up to you with something in his 
      hands.</p>
      
    <p>"So, um. Sorry for kidnapping you," he says too brightly for the words that just came out 
      of his mouth. "Here's my business card. If you need anything, we'll find a way to make it up 
      to you."</p>
      
    <p>He holds out the card with both hands like exchanging business cards is a thing middle 
      schoolers do. Or maybe they do. You haven't been in middle school for a while. Maybe this 
      is the new Pokemon.</p>
      
    <p>You take the card, anyway. It's entirely in Japanese, but you're pretty sure you see the 
      word for "hospital" on it.</p>
      
    <p>"Anyway, we need to go hunt down the guy that tried to get you into drug trafficking, and 
      our flight leaves in a few hours. See you." He waves and wanders out with the lady.</p>
      
    <p>The room fades out to silence once they're out the door, save Mark slurping his noodles 
      like he's going to starve if he doesn't.</p>
      
    <p>"So," Chia-wei says slowly. "How did you like your brush with the yakuza?"</p>
    
    <p>"I vote we never do that again," Mark says around his noodles. "Anyway, fun fact: 
      <span class="currentCity">Springville</span>'s at <span class="tianqiHum">32</span> 
      percent humidity right now."</p>
      
    <p>"Is it," you mumble, wondering how much money it would cost to bury today's events 
      in dumplings.</p>
