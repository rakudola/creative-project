    <h2 id="ch1-begin">Chapter 1</h2>
    
    <p>You have had 1 (one) customer come in so far today.</p>
    
    <p>The weather can't decide if it's (freezing) raining or not, which never means good things for business. 
      Cafes toeing the border between the town and the ooky spooky forest get regulars, sure, but 
      most of them pop in in the morning, order their coffee black with 12 shots of espresso, 
      and walk out in under five minutes without another word. Nobody wanders around the edge of 
      town and pops into some random cafe when the sky might decide to unleash frozen divine
      judgement on the unsuspecting townsfolk at any second.</p>
      
    <p>Except for this dude.</p>
    
    <p>"Morning," he chirps, not at all phased by the rainwater sliding down his face. There's ice
      in his hair. "Nice weather today, isn't it?"</p>
      
    <p>You can't tell if that's sarcasm or not, so you slap a smile on your face and make some
      noise you hope is agreeable enough that he orders something.</p>
      
    <p>He hums and scans the menu behind you. His eyes are closed. (He hasn't opened them since he walked in.)</p>
    
    <p>"In the mood for something hot?" You ask. It's nothing conversation worthy, but you 
      hadn't expected any customers until the weather clears up a bit, and anyone walking 
      around outside in this weather isn't in their right mind. Or sober.</p>
      
    <p>The guy tilts his head, still staring pensively at the menu through closed eyelids.</p>
    
    <p>His movement lets you catch a glimpse of a literal eagle perched on one of your chairs outside. It's 
      deep brown with golden accents, chilling under a table umbrella, and staring straight at you.</p>
      
    <p>Yeah, you're not liking this entire situation one bit.</p>
    
    <p>Have you mildly inconvenienced any fae recently?</p>
    
    <p>"Ah, can I have a green tea lemonade, please?" He asks with a smile.</p>
    
    <p>"That's an iced drink," you say, mind going a thousand miles a minute. This guy walks in in 
      this weather and wants an iced drink? He's either on every drug ever invented, or he's 
      with the (is a?) fae. Neither option bodes well for you. "Do you want me to warm it up for 
      you?"</p>
      
    <p>"No, thank you," he says. "Iced is fine."</p>
    
    <p>You get the distinct feeling that your days are numbered. Like, in the single digits numbered.</p>
    
    <p>"Anything else?"</p>
    
    <p>The eagle's still staring at you through the window.</p>
    
    <p>"No, that's it for the moment, thanks."</p>
    
    <p>The rain picks up again, pelting the windows. The eagle seems unconcerned.</p>
    
    <p>"Can I get a name for the order?"</p>
    
    <p>"Sure. It's Ren."</p>
    
    <p>"Alright, I'll have your drink ready in a few minutes."</p>
    
    <p>You turn around to busy yourself with an iced green tea lemonade and hope to whoever might 
      possibly be listening that this guy just wants to come in, get his iced tea, and leave.</p>
      
    <p>Predictably, whoever is listening laughs at you.</p>
    
    <p>"Sorry, one more thing," Ren says, sounding genuinely apologetic, and you're already 
      wondering why the last thing you sent your mom was a Spongebob gif. You're going out on a 
      Spongebob gif.</p>
      
    <p>"Yeah?" You ask, turning around a little more slowly than the situation probably dictates.</p>
    
    <p>He's still smiling, but his head's between you and the eagle again. "I need some magic help."</p>
    
    <p>Oh, son of a gun, he's an undercover cop. Of course he is.</p>
    
    <p>"Magic?" You raise an eyebrow for dramatically confused effect. "We took the Magic Macchiato 
      off the menu in April, sorry."</p>
      
    <p>"That sounds lovely, but also like the sugar content might kill me." The smile slips off 
      his face. "But, no, I wasn't talking about that. You already know that."</p>
      
    <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," you say. He probably doesn't have a warrant. 
      Maybe your mom was right about networking with lawyers.</p>
      
    <p>His eyes snap open, and <i>ooh</i> that's not a human color. Yeah, you messed 
      this one up big time.</p>
    
    <p>"<span class="givenName">Lucia</span> <span class="familyName">Cafaro</span>," he says. 
      "Known by the entire Salerno magical legal enforcement due to constant scrapes with 
      the Masquerade Act, renowned throughout Campania for genius if unorthodox magical 
      innovation, arrested at least three times and eventually banned from your home country 
      for illegal spell synthesis. I believe you know what I'm talking about."</p>
      
    <p>It's hard to keep your voice neutral when you're aware this guy is probably about to 
      squash you like a bug for your human insolence, but you still manage a "That's me."</p>
      
    <p>He smiles at you again, eyes sliding shut.</p>
    
    <p>"Oh, good, because this would be awkward otherwise." He slams a bag you hadn't seen him 
      bring in on the counter and opens it. There's an obscene amount of money inside. You're 
      pretty sure you could buy a small country with the amount of cold cash sparkling at you 
      from Ren's ugly brown bag.</p>
      
    <p>"What," you say, because you genuinely no longer have any idea what is happening.</p>
    
    <p>"I can give you this much, if that's okay," he says like he offered you five bucks and 
      not the entire Federal Reserve.</p>
      
    <p>"For what?"</p>
    
    <p>"Could you help me kidnap a kid, please?"</p>

    <p>"No," you say firmly. "I don't know who you are, I don't know what your motives are, 
      and I'm not kidnapping a kid."</p>
    
    <p>Ren shrugs. "I get it. I hope you understand I can't leave you with this knowledge, 
      though."</p>
      
    <p>You don't know what that means.</p>
    
    <p>You wake up with your clock reading 1:39 PM and promptly freak out, because you fell 
      asleep yesterday just fine and can't imagine why you woke up so late. Your cafe was 
      closed through the entire morning rush!</p>
      
    <p>The sound of rain pelting your windows fades into your peripherals. Has it been 
      raining all day? Business is pretty slow when it rains. Maybe you didn't miss too 
      much.</p>
      
    <p>It was sunny yesterday morning. At least you were awake for that.</p>
    
    <p>The TV's running in the background a few years later when the leaders of that Olive Branch 
      thief ring get arrested. You manage to catch that one is named Sy Lin, and the other's 
      got a name so long the display can't fit it. Everyone calls him "Ren."</p>
      
    <p>You feel like you've forgotten something when their mugshots flash across the screen. 
      Ren's eyes are closed, for some reason. Maybe you saw them in the street at some point.</p>
      
    <p>You move to slam the next order on the counter. No use worrying about it now.</p>
    
    <p>You never catch news on either of them again.</p>
